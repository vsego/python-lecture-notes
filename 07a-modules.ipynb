    "# Modules\n",
    "\n",
    "General purpose programming languages like Python have a very wide area of applications and building all the required functionality into any of them would be almost impossible, and certainly cumbersome at best. The main reasons for this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Such language would grow huge, in terms of disk requirements and in the syntax it would have to support. Consequentially, it would also grow very slow and become very memory greedy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. All new features and upgrades would require reinstall of the whole language (compiler or interpreter).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Only the developers of the language itself would be able to implement the features, which would require a huge effort and a wide area of expertise from a relatively small group of people.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, programming languages are made extensible. In Python (and PERL, for example), these extensions are called *modules*. In other languages they may be called libraries (C, PHP,...) or packages (MATLAB, Mathematica, $\\LaTeX$...), but they all work on a fairly similar concept: inclusion of some code written in that or even another language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules contain functions and other objects. We can *include* or, equvalently, *import* them, making some or all of these objects available in our program."

    "\n",
    "[SciPy library](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/) has some overlap with NumPy, for example in [linear algebra](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/linalg.html) and [statistics](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/tutorial/stats.html) functions. This difference is best described by [SciPy's FAQ](http://www.scipy.org/scipylib/faq.html#what-is-the-difference-between-numpy-and-scipy):\n",
    "\n",
    "> #### What is the difference between NumPy and SciPy?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In an ideal world, NumPy would contain nothing but the array data type and the most basic operations: indexing, sorting, reshaping, basic elementwise functions, et cetera. All numerical code would reside in SciPy. However, one of NumPy’s important goals is compatibility, so NumPy tries to retain all features supported by either of its predecessors. Thus NumPy contains some linear algebra functions, even though these more properly belong in SciPy. In any case, SciPy contains more fully-featured versions of the linear algebra modules, as well as many other numerical algorithms. If you are doing scientific computing with python, you should probably install both NumPy and SciPy. Most new features belong in SciPy rather than NumPy.\n",
